This is a small project I made as I "explored" evolution through [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life).

**Emoji mode** provides a fun way of seeing change over time: namely, how many generations a cell has lasted. It assumes that each cell has the following lifecycle:

*It begins life as a baby, and matures into a new state every five generations, ultimately becoming a wizard if it survives long enough, because why not?*

| Generations | Cell Emoji |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | 👶🏻 |
| 6 | 👨🏻 |
| 11 | 👴🏻 |
| 16 | 🧙‍♂️ |
